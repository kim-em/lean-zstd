# XXH64 Specification Predicates (xxHash specification)

Formal specification of the XXH64 hash function used by Zstandard (RFC 8878)
for optional content checksums.  The upper 32 bits of `xxHash64 data 0` are
stored as a checksum in Zstd frame footers when `Content_Checksum` is set.

**Spec level**: Algorithmic correspondence (tier 3).  Unlike CRC-32, xxHash
is not algebraically compositional — it is designed for speed, not mathematical
elegance.  The reference algorithm (xxHash specification by Yann Collet) IS the
spec, so our predicates formalize the structural steps of that algorithm rather
than abstract mathematical properties.

The specification is structured in layers:
1. **Prime constants**: the 5 XXH64 prime values match the spec
2. **Round step**: single accumulator update rule
3. **Convergence**: 4-accumulator merge after stripe processing
4. **Avalanche**: final 3-step mixing
5. **Remaining byte processing**: tail handling (8-byte, 4-byte, 1-byte chunks)

Correctness theorems prove empty-input characterization, expansion
equivalences, and the connection between `xxHash64Upper32` and the full
`xxHash64` function.

/-! ## Prime constant validation -/

/-- The five XXH64 prime constants have the correct values from the xxHash
    specification.  These are fixed constants, not configurable parameters. -/
def ValidPrimes : Prop :=
  XxHash64.PRIME64_1 = 0x9E3779B185EBCA87 ∧
  XxHash64.PRIME64_2 = 0xC2B2AE3D27D4EB4F ∧
  XxHash64.PRIME64_3 = 0x165667B19E3779F9 ∧

instance : Decidable ValidPrimes :=
  inferInstanceAs (Decidable (_ ∧ _ ∧ _ ∧ _ ∧ _))

/-! ## Accumulator round step -/

/-- A single round step applies the transformation:
    `acc ← rotl((acc + lane × PRIME2), 31) × PRIME1`
    This predicate states that `round` computes exactly this. -/
def ValidRound (acc lane result : UInt64) : Prop :=
  result = XxHash64.round acc lane

instance : Decidable (ValidRound acc lane result) :=
  inferInstanceAs (Decidable (_ = _))

/-- The round function expands to its constituent operations:
    add, multiply by PRIME2, rotate left by 31, multiply by PRIME1. -/
def RoundExpansion (acc lane result : UInt64) : Prop :=
  result = (XxHash64.rotl (acc + lane * XxHash64.PRIME64_2) 31) * XxHash64.PRIME64_1

instance : Decidable (RoundExpansion acc lane result) :=
  inferInstanceAs (Decidable (_ = _))

/-! ## Accumulator convergence -/

/-- Captures the 4-accumulator state after processing 32-byte stripes. -/
structure RoundState where
  acc1 : UInt64
  acc2 : UInt64
  acc3 : UInt64
  acc4 : UInt64
  deriving Repr, DecidableEq

/-- Initial accumulator state for a given seed. -/

  acc2 := seed + XxHash64.PRIME64_2
  acc3 := seed
  acc4 := seed - XxHash64.PRIME64_1

/-- The convergence step merges the 4 accumulators into a single hash value
    via rotation and `mergeAccumulator`:
    `h = rotl(acc1,1) + rotl(acc2,7) + rotl(acc3,12) + rotl(acc4,18)`
    followed by merging each accumulator. -/
def ValidConvergence (st : RoundState) (result : UInt64) : Prop :=
  let h := XxHash64.rotl st.acc1 1 + XxHash64.rotl st.acc2 7 +
           XxHash64.rotl st.acc3 12 + XxHash64.rotl st.acc4 18

  let h := XxHash64.mergeAccumulator h st.acc3
  result = XxHash64.mergeAccumulator h st.acc4

instance : Decidable (ValidConvergence st result) :=
  inferInstanceAs (Decidable (_ = _))

/-! ## Avalanche mixing -/

/-- The 3-step avalanche mixing applied as the final hash finalization:
    1. `h ← (h ⊕ (h >>> 33)) × PRIME2`
    2. `h ← (h ⊕ (h >>> 29)) × PRIME3`
    3. `h ← h ⊕ (h >>> 32)` -/

  inferInstanceAs (Decidable (_ = _))

/-! ## Remaining byte processing -/

/-- The tail processing handles bytes remaining after full 32-byte stripes,
    consuming 8-byte, then 4-byte, then 1-byte chunks sequentially. -/
def ValidProcessRemaining (acc : UInt64) (data : ByteArray) (off len : Nat)

  result = XxHash64.processRemaining acc data off len

/-! ## Test vector verification

These theorems state xxHash64 test vectors from the xxHash specification.
The proofs are left as `sorry` because UInt64 computations (64-bit arithmetic
with wrapping) are too expensive for kernel evaluation (`decide_cbv` times out).
The same test vectors are verified at runtime in `ZipTest/XxHashNative.lean`. -/
